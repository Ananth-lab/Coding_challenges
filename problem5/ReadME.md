Write a program to print whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not..

(Armstrong number is a number in which all the sum of cubes of digits is equal to the number

Example:-

Input

n=153

Output

true



Logic - 153 is an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 +125 + 27 = 153 which is equal to the original number )



Input

123

Output

false



Logic - 123 is not an Armstrong number because 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 8 + 27 = 36 which is not equal to the original number )
